How many doors will be open at the end, when you finish?",
  "image": "doors",
  "answer": "10",
  "solution": "All numbers except the squares have even number of factors, so if all those doors which are at position number N, where N is not a square should remain closed at the last pass. So, all those doors which are open are 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100. All others remain closed.",

  "name": "Weighing marbles",
  "question": "You are given 25 marbles - all identical looking. 24 are identical in mass, the 25th is slightly heavier than the rest. You also have an old-fashioned balancing scale (one that only shows which side is heavier). What is the minimal number of times you have to use the balancing scale to find the heavier marble, if you cannot use any weights other than the marbles?",
  "image": "scales",
  "answer": "3",
  "solution": "Divide the marbles into 3 groups: of 9, of 9, and of 7 marbles. First, compare the first two groups – if one of them is heavier than the other one, then divide it into 3 groups of 3 marbles and compare 2 of them. Again, if one of them is heavier than the other, then the heavier marble must be in it, and you can easily find it by comparing two marbles out of that little group. If the first two groups of 9 are equal in weight, then the heavier marble must be in the remaining group of 7. Then you can add 2 random marbles to it (from one of the previous groups), and then determine the heavier marble in 2 extra steps as described above. You need 3 comparisons in total.",
